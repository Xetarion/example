*Fixing* - We are ongoingly fixing some bugs seen within Gun Point: Vendetta. For now, we have set the game into a scheduled downtime maintenance mode. If you have any questions, please contact us at [summitcustomercare@gmail.com](mailto:summitcustomercare@gmail.com)

﻿*Testing* - We are testing the bug fixes and seeing if it works, we will be staying in our downtime maintenance state as this may affect gameplay. All data has been backed up and saved.

﻿*Update* - We have been working hard to get the bugs fixed but they did not work. So therefore we are going to have to start over with the console data and go find the root cause of the bugs.

﻿*Update* - We are mitigating the game services to get it up and running again. Alongside Parties Friends and Messaging that is on a partial outage. Matchmaking and the Item Shop are back up and running. We are still working on getting it all back up and operational.
